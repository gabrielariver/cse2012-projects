The provided code comprises a system for online orders with four classes:
`Product`, `Customer`, `Address`, and `Order`. Each class encapsulates its specific functionality, 
adhering to the encapsulation principle. The `Product` class encapsulates product details such as name, ID, 
price, and quantity. `Customer` encapsulates customer data, including name and address, with `Address` 
encapsulating address details. `Order` encapsulates logic for managing orders, calculating total cost, 
and generating packing and shipping labels. This ensures a clear and modular design, where each class has 
well-defined responsibilities, and direct access to private members of the classes from outside is restricted.
