Each type of activity (Running, StationaryBicycle, and Swimming) is implemented as a separate class that inherits 
from the abstract class Activity. Each derived class implements its own calculations for distance, speed, pace, 
and activity-specific summary. This demonstrates the use of inheritance to avoid code duplication and promotes 
reuse of common functionalities. Additionally, the implementation of the GetSummary() method showcases polymorphism, 
as each activity instance invokes its own GetSummary() method, which is specific to its activity type.
