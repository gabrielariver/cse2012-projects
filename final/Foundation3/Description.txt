Different types of events are defined: ConferenceEvent, ReceptionEvent, and OutdoorMeetingEvent, 
each extending the base class Event. The Event class encapsulates common attributes for all events, 
such as title, description, date, time, and address. Each derived class adds specific details for the type of event, 
such as speaker's name for conferences, email for RSVP for receptions, and weather forecast for outdoor meetings.
This demonstrates the use of inheritance in the system design, where derived classes inherit attributes and behaviors 
from the base class, allowing for a more efficient and organized implementation of the system.
